Proposal docs for Quibic

## The current state of Qubic documentation: 
There is an existing repository of Qubic Documentation, that may be of limited use to users.
As a result, Qubic risks alienating users, who cannot access information allowing them to use the product. A quick review of the existing documentation reveals several gaps, including: 

* Missing Tutorials - the Qubic Tutorial page is not readily available in the navigation bar and key tutorials are missing `[INSERT WHAT IS MISSING HERE]`

* Missing general information - for example, parts of the 'Core Concepts' pages are missing, including formatting, signatures and other instructions. Similar gaps are found throughout the documentation

* Inconsistent information and language in parts

* Broken links

A more thorough review will be done as part of this proposal, which will likely reveal further gaps that will also need addressing. 


## Objectives of the Rewrite
Qubic and its quorum-based computing software represent an innovative step in decentralised technology and finance.
The technology will require thorough and accurate documentation, in order to ensure users are able to engage with the product comfortably and securely. Current documentation exists, but lacks key information. By rewriting parts and editing others, Qubic documentation will be brought up to date, improving overall user friendliness and aiding developers in using Qubic tools.


## Milestones 

This project will consist of three main stages: 

Stage 1: Review and Major Rewrites - This stage will include a full review of the existing documentation, identifying its strengths and weaknesses, to be used, discarded or built upon. Major rewrites will be done as necessary, reducing obvious gaps in documentation. This stage will be the most intensive and create the foundation for stages two and three. 

Stage 2: Major Edits - A full edit will be done for each page of documentation, including structural edits, copy editing and proofreading. This will help focus the messaging of each page, make information clearer for users, help catch errors and give the documentation a professional feel. 

Stage 3: Testing - `[I need more info re: what we plan to do here]`


## Estimated Time Needed, Expenses and Deliverables

Stage 1 - With around 80 pages of review, at 30 minutes of review per page (40 hours). Major rewrites will be more intensive at around three hours per page. Assuming one-third (27) of pages will need rewrites, this will be around 80 hours. 

Stage 2 - With one hour of edits for pages that did not need a rewrite (50 hours) and 20 minutes for those that did (10 hours)

Stage 3 - API checks, installing and running Qubic Software - approx. 15 hours. 

Total - 195 hours
Budget: Â£19,500 GBP (approx. $24,000 USD)
