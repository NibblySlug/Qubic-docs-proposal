# qubic-docs-proposal
Proposal docs for Quibic

## Objectives of the Rewrite
Qubic and its quorum-based computing software represent an innovative step in decentralised technology and finance.
The technology will require thorough and accurate documentation, in order to ensure users are able to engage with the product comfortably and securely. 

## The current state of Qubic documentation: 
There is an existing repository of Qubic Documentation, that may be of limited use to users.
As a result, Qubic risks alienating users, who cannot access information allowing them to use the product. Gaps include: 

* Missing Tutorials - the Qubic Tutorial page is not readily available in the navigation bar and key tutorials are missing `[INSERT WHAT IS MISSING HERE]`

* Missing general information - parts of the 'Core Concepts' pages are missing, including formatting, signatures and other instructions. 




## Milestones 

This project will consist of three main stages: 

Stage 1: Review and Major Rewrites - 

Stage 2: Major Edits - 

Stage 3: Testing - 


## Estimated Time Needed

Stage 1 - Assuming 80 pages of review, at 30 minutes of review per page (40 hours). Major rewrites will be more intensive at around three hours per page. Assuming one-third (27) of pages will need rewrites, this will be around 80 hours. 

Stage 2 - Assuming one hour of edits for pages that did not need a rewrite (50 hours) and 20 minutes for those that did (10 hours)

Stage 3 - API checks, installing and running Qubic Software - approx. 15 hours. 

Total - 195 hours
